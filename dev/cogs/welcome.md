summary: "Welcomes new users to the server and logs users joining/leaving."

The Welcome cog welcomes new users to the server in the #general channel. This
serves as a replacement to Discord's terrible built-in welcome messages.

This cog also logs users joining and leaving the server to #bot_output, for
moderation purposes, such as detecting raids, impersonation and ban evasion.

It has no usable commands.
