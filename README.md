# KazTron

A Discord bot framework, currently in use at:

* the /r/Worldbuilding Discord server ([manual](http://worldbuilding.network/kaztron))
* the Inkblood Writing Guild Discord server ([manual](http://inkblood.arenthil.net))
* the Writer Lounge Discord server

## Requirements

* Python version: 3.6.x required (not compatible with 3.7 for now - due to old version of discord.py)
* Dependencies: [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)
* Note: there is a dependency version conflict with aiohttp (asyncprawcore and discord.py dependency). A newer version is specified than discord.py is compatible with, but this appears to work fine, pending migration to the post-rewrite discord.py releases.

## Development

* [Development roadmap](https://github.com/Worldbuilding/KazTron/milestones)
* Inquiries can be directed to /r/worldbuilding's modmail on reddit, or the #meta channel the /r/Worldbuilding Discord server.
