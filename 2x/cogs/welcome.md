title: "Welcome"
last_updated: 26 October 2020
summary: "Welcomes new users to the server and logs users joining/leaving."
---

The Welcome cog welcomes new users to the server in the #worldbuilding channel. This
serves as a replacement to Discord's terrible built-in welcome messages. It also announces
users who leave the server.

This cog also logs users joining and leaving the server to #bot-output, for
moderation purposes, such as detecting raids, impersonation and ban evasion.

It has no usable commands.
