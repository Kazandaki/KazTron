An orphan wakes up to find that she's been left behind amidst an evacuated city; a star pilot of the Melboum Air Force stumbles upon a revolutionary conspiracy forming within the armed forces. In the face of mortal danger, how will they survive?","This is a very long description. However, since this is just an example, I don't feel like inventing that detailed a story just for the sake of a software example, so I'm going to stream-of-consciousness this description. Pretend I'm giving a more detailed 200-word synopsis of the ""Emu Wars"" story, and not just spouting this nonsense that I'm typing right now. So, how about some tea? Yeah, I'm totally running out of things to say. I wonder how long this is. Eh, looks good enough. Bye!",
